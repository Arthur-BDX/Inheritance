# Inheritance
This project involves interacting with a smart contract named InheritanceContract, which automates inheritance logic on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The smart contract allows a designated owner to withdraw funds, set a new heir, and has mechanisms for the heir to claim ownership after a certain period of inactivity by the owner.

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 14 or later)
ethers.js 5.7

Make sure to create a keys.json file with your private keys. The structure of the file should be:
{
  "private-key": "<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>",
  "public-key": "<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>"
}
